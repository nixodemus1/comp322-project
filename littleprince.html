As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
<div1 class="underline">I felt deeply moved, and stirred.It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. </div1>
<div2 class="highlight">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</div2>

his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
<div3 class="red">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</div3>

<div4 class="red">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when his is asleep..."</div4>

 <div5 class="underline">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</div5>
